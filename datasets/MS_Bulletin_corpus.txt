a O
vulnerability O
. O

The O
following O
mitigating O
factors O
may O
be O
helpful O
in O
your O
situation O
: O
An O
attacker O
who O
successfully O
exploited O
this O
vulnerability O
could O
gain B-relevantTerm
the O
same O
user O
rights O
as O
the O
local B-relevantTerm
user O
. O

Users O
whose O
accounts O
are O
configured O
to O
have O
fewer O
user O
rights O
on O
the O
system O
could O
be O
less O
impacted O
than O
users O
who O
operate O
with O
administrative O
user O
rights O
. O

There O
are O
two O
types O
of O
systems O
at O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O
, O
described O
as O
follows O
: O
systems O
that O
are O
using O
the O
web O
browsing O
scenario O
and O
systems O
that O
are O
using O
the O
Windows B-os
.NET B-application
Framework I-application
applications O
scenario O
. O

Web O
browsing O
scenario O
Successful O
exploitation O
of O
this O
vulnerability O
requires O
that O
a O
user O
is O
logged O
on O
and O
is O
visiting O
websites O
using O
a O
web O
browser O
capable O
of O
instantiating O
XBAPs O
. O

Therefore O
, O
any O
systems O
where O
a O
web O
browser O
is O
used O
frequently O
, O
such O
as O
workstations O
or O
terminal O

, O
are O
at O
the O
most O
risk O
from O
this O
vulnerability O
. O

Servers O
could O
be O
at O
more O
risk O
if O
administrators O
allow O
users O
to O
browse O
and O
read O

. O

However O
, O
best O
practices O
strongly O
discourage O
allowing O
