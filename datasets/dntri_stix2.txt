Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 B-APT
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China B-LOC
's O
cyber O
threat I-APT
actors I-APT
. O

FireEye B-SECTEAM
said O
it O
has O
tracked O
admin@338 B-APT
's O
activity B-ACT
since O
2013 B-TIME
and O
the O

has O
largely O

involved O
in O
financial B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
economic I-IDTY
, I-IDTY
and I-IDTY
trade I-IDTY
policy I-IDTY
. O

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 B-APT
is O
operating O
in O
China B-LOC
, O
and O
most O
likely O
in O
Shanghai B-LOC
. O

These O
data O
sets O
show O
that O
APT1 B-APT
is O
either O
operating O
in O
China B-LOC
during O
normal O
Chinese B-LOC
business O
hours O
or O
that O
APT1 B-APT
is O
intentionally O
going O
to O
painstaking O
lengths O
to O
look O
like O
they O
are O
. O

APT1 B-APT
has O
used O
and O
steadily O
modified O

as O
early O
as O
2007 B-TIME
and O
continues O
to O
use O
it O
presently O
. O

While O
APT1 B-APT
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly B-MAL
available I-MAL
backdoors I-MAL
such O
as O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy I-MAL

Gh0st B-MAL

Given O
the O
mission O
, O
resourcing O
, O
and O

of O
PLA B-APT
Unit I-APT
61398 I-APT
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
PLA B-APT
Unit I-APT
61398 I-APT
is O
APT1 B-APT
. O

APT1 B-APT
were O
a O
highly O
prolific O

out O
of O

APT1 B-APT
is O
a O
China-based B-LOC
cyber-espionage B-APT

active O
since O

we O
call O
HIGHTIDE B-MAL

However O
, O
the O
malware O
shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE B-MAL
and O
HIGHTIDE B-TOOL
backdoor I-MAL
that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 B-APT
. O

From O
October B-TIME
2012 I-TIME
to O
May B-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
observed O

However O
, O
three O

clearly O
reflects O
areas O

interest O
to O
an O
Eastern B-LOC

government B-IDTY
, O
most O
likely O
the O
Russian B-LOC

We O
identified O
three O
themes O
in O
APT28 B-APT

lures O
and O
registered O
domains O
, O
which O
together O
are O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
the O
Russian B-LOC

Georgian O
military O
security O
issues O
, O
particularly O
with O
regard O
to O
U.S. B-LOC
cooperation O

NATO B-IDTY
, O
provide O
a O
strong O
incentive O
for O
Russian B-LOC

APT28 B-APT
actors I-APT
to O
steal B-ACT

Instead O

we O
observed O
the O
two O

engage O
separately O
in O
the O
theft B-ACT

APT28 B-APT

that O
the O

their O
work O
in O
a O
Russian B-LOC

which O
suggests O
that O
the O

We O
believe O
that O
APT28 B-APT

targeting O
of O
the O
MOD O
aligns O
with O
Russian B-LOC

perceptions O
. O

We O
assess O
that O
APT28 B-APT

most O
likely O
sponsored O

Given O

that O

The O
Dukes B-APT
are O
a O
well-resourced O
, O
highly O
dedicated O
and O
organized O
cyberespionage B-APT
group I-APT
that O
we O
believe O
has O
been O

since O
at O
least O
2008 B-TIME
to O
collect B-ACT
intelligence B-IDTY
in O
support O
of O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O
decision-making O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke B-MAL
, O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
, O
OnionDuke B-MAL
, O
CozyDuke B-MAL
, O
CloudDuke B-MAL
, O
SeaDuke B-MAL
, O
HammerDuke B-MAL
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
, O
and O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke B-MAL
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs I-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-MAL
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-MAL
malware I-MAL
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
, O
and O
thus O
the O
group O
threat O
actor I-APT
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes B-APT
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign B-ACT
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-TOOL
samples I-MAL
discovered O
from O
2009 B-TIME
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense I-IDTY
of O
Georgia O
and O
the O
ministries B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
foreign I-IDTY
affairs I-IDTY
of O
Turkey B-LOC
and O
Uganda B-LOC
. O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
trojan I-MAL
samples I-MAL
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign B-ACT
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
, O
and O
MiniDuke B-MAL
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 B-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
CozyDuke B-MAL
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 I-TIME
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian B-LOC
Dukes B-APT
actors I-APT
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT
Storm I-ACT
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine B-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia B-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia B-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine B-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-APT
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 I-TIME
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-MAL
and O
HammerDuke B-MAL
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
of O
February B-TIME
2013 I-TIME
and O
CosmicDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
in O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, O
again O
the O
Dukes B-APT
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns B-ACT
with O
CozyDuke B-MAL
and O
CloudDuke B-MAL
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert B-ACT
, I-ACT
surgical I-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
using O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation B-ACT
of O
CVE-2013-0640 B-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day B-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
Dukes B-APT
acquired O
the O
exploit O
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
Dukes B-APT
operates O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation O
. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O
zone O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
timestamps O
found O
in O
many O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
samples I-MAL
, O
which O
similarly O
suggest O
the O
Dukes B-APT
work O
in O
the O
Moscow O
Standard O
Time O
timezone O
, O
as O
further O
detailed O
in O
the O
section O
on O
the O
technical O
analysis O
of O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
. O

POSHSPY B-MAL
in O
several O

over O
the O
past O
two O
years O

In O
the O
investigations O
Mandiant B-SECTEAM
has O
conducted O
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
APT29 B-APT
deployed O
POSHSPY B-MAL
as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
for O
use O
if O
they O
lost O
access O
to O
their O
primary O

POSHSPY B-MAL

APT38 B-APT
is O
believed O
to O
operate O
more O
similarly O
to O
an O
espionage B-ACT
operation O
, O
carefully O
conducting O

balancing B-ACT

although O

We O
consider O
APT38 B-APT

operations O
more O
global O
and O
highly O
specialized O

targeting O
the O
financial B-IDTY
sector I-IDTY

APT38 B-APT
is O
a O
financially B-ACT
motivated I-ACT
linked O
to O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
group O
cyber O

operators I-APT
, O
renown O
for O

to O
steal B-ACT
hundreds I-ACT

millions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
dollars I-ACT
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O
destructive O

. O

Because O
APT38 B-APT
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O
behalf O
of O
) O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
as O
an O
" O
group O
APT O
" O
instead O
of O
a O

Over O

these O

diverged O
, O
as O
did O

TTPs O

almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit B-ACT

is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational B-APT
groups I-APT
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O

resources O
and O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
state O

. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity B-ACT
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise B-ACT
large I-ACT
sums I-ACT
of I-IDTY
money I-ACT
for O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 B-TIME
, O
APT38 B-APT
has O
attempted O
to O
steal B-ACT
hundreds I-ACT
of I-IDTY
millions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
dollars I-ACT
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
. O

APT38 B-APT
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks B-IDTY
and O
financial B-IDTY
entities I-IDTY
since O
at O
least O
2014 B-TIME
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks B-IDTY
, O
media B-IDTY
, O
and O
government B-IDTY
agencies I-IDTY
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 B-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 B-APT
targeted O
news B-IDTY
outlets I-IDTY
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial B-IDTY
sector I-IDTY
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
. O

APT38 B-APT
also O
targeted O
financial B-IDTY
transaction I-IDTY
exchange I-IDTY
companies I-IDTY
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks B-IDTY
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing B-ACT
and O
the O
heist B-ACT
activity I-ACT
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
under O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O

one O
associated O
with O

TEMP.Hermit B-APT
or O
a O
related O
groups O

) O
and O
another O
for O
the O
heists O
( O
APT38 B-APT
) O
. O

APT38 B-APT
, O
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT B-TOOL
fraud O
to O
steal B-ACT
millions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
dollars I-ACT
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-ACT
operator I-ACT
activity I-ACT
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O
, O
including O
motivation O
, O
malware O

and O
TTPs O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
statesponsored O
operations O

As O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
APT38 B-APT
's O
mission O
is O
focused O
on O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY

raise B-ACT
money I-ACT

Since O

the O

While O
North B-LOC
Korean I-LOC

may O
have O
been O
driven O
by O

the O
application O

probably O
contributed O
to O
the O
formation O
of O

APT38 B-APT

operations B-ACT
began O
in O
February B-TIME

we O
call O
GCMAN B-APT
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O

In O
all O

the O
Lazarus B-APT
utilized O
similar O
toolsets O
, O
including O
KillDisk B-MAL
that O
was O
executed O
on O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk B-MAL
malware I-MAL
was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus B-APT
, O
rather O
than O
by O
another O
, O
unrelated O
attacker O
. O

This O
recent O
attack B-ACT
against O
an O
online O
casino O
in O
Central B-LOC
America I-LOC
suggests O
that O
hacking B-ACT
tools O
from O
the O

are O
recompiled O
with O
every O
attack B-ACT
( O
we O
didn't O
see O
these O
exact O
samples O
anywhere O
else O
) O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk B-MAL
in O
the O
attack B-ACT
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers O
covering B-ACT
their I-ACT
tracks I-ACT
after O
an O
espionage B-ACT
operation O
, O
or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O
extortion B-ACT
or O
cyber-sabotage B-APT
. O

Today O
we'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
findings O
, O
and O
add O
something O
new O
to O
what O
's O
currently O
common O
knowledge O
about O
Lazarus B-ACT
Group I-ACT
activities I-ACT
, O
and O
their O
connection O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February B-TIME
2016 I-TIME
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
cyber-sabotage B-APT
attempted O
to O
steal B-ACT
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh B-IDTY
Central I-IDTY
Bank I-IDTY
. O

Since O
the O
Bangladesh B-LOC
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
and O
the O
Bangladesh B-LOC
bank B-IDTY
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks B-IDTY
. O

Symantec B-SECTEAM
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland B-LOC
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers B-IDTY
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media B-IDTY
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers O
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus B-APT
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus B-APT
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks B-IDTY
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks B-ACT
on O
banks B-IDTY
to O
Lazarus B-APT
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker O
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack B-ACT
in O
Europe B-LOC
in O
2017 B-TIME
. O

Lazarus B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-ACT
and I-ACT
cybersabotage I-ACT
activities I-ACT
, O
such O
as O
attacks B-ACT
on O
Sony B-IDTY
Pictures I-IDTY
Entertainment I-IDTY
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage B-ACT
operations I-ACT
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-APT
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks B-IDTY
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
group I-APT
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking B-IDTY
sector I-IDTY
, O
finance B-IDTY
, O
and O
trading B-IDTY
companies I-IDTY
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos B-IDTY
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-APT
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
attack I-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
2016 I-TIME
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC

. O

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME

after O
their O
other O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
provides O
keylogging B-ACT
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
's O
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence B-ACT
functionality I-ACT
and O
the O
keylogging B-TOOL
functionality I-TOOL
. O

The O
persistence B-ACT
functionality I-ACT
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
uses O
compromised B-TOOL
infrastructure I-TOOL
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-MAL
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
malware I-MAL
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-TOOL
DLL I-TOOL
and O
standalone B-TOOL
executable I-TOOL
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-MAL
installer I-MAL
is O
responsible O
for O
installing B-ACT
the I-ACT
service I-ACT
DLL I-ACT
variant I-ACT
. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
's O
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage B-APT
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious B-ACT
activity I-ACT
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting B-ACT
of I-IDTY
antivirus I-ACT
capabilities I-ACT
and O
the O
disabling B-ACT
of I-IDTY
firewalls I-ACT
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
very O
fundamental O
defensive O
measures O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
like O
many O
other O
identified O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
families O
, O
these O
tools O
showcase O
the O
group O
's O
creative O
solutions O
, O
such O
as O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
, O
which O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
immediately O
identify O
potentially O
malicious B-ACT
activity I-ACT
on O
a O
compromised O
network O

about O
a O
cyber B-ACT
espionage I-ACT
attack I-ACT
using O
the O
Emissary B-MAL
Trojan I-MAL
as O
a O

. O

The O
oldest O

was O
created O
in O
2009 B-TIME

indicating O
this O

this O

three O

One O
of O
the O

is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O

devoted O
to O

significantly O
increased O
after O
we O
published O
our O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary B-MAL
as O
early O
as O
2009 B-TIME
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
Lotus B-APT

have O
relied O
on O
this O

as O
a O

in O
cyber-espionage B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
for O
many O
years O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O
advanced O

it O

still O

the O

that O

including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O

which O
we O
have O

the O
targeting O

therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O

Given O
the O

have O
, O
once O
APT10 B-APT
has O
gained O
access O

it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O

exploit O

move O

onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O

APT10 B-APT
achieves O

primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-TOOL

, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising B-ACT
high I-ACT

the O
APT10 B-APT
actor I-APT

are O
thus O
less O

to O
draw O
the O
attention O

In O
the O

APT10 B-APT
used O
either O
a O

the O

what O
the O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
worrying O
discovery O
we O
made O
was O
that O
Thrip O
had O
targeted O
a O
satellite B-IDTY

Thrip O
seemed O
to O
be O
mainly O
interested O

This O
suggests O
to O
us O
that O

motives O
go O

may O
also O
include O

cases O

based O

the O
nature O

it O

that O

VENOMOUS B-APT
BEAR I-APT
is O
an O
advanced O

Russia-based B-LOC
adversary O
that's O
been O
active O
since O
at O

2004 B-TIME
. O

Venomous B-APT
Bear I-APT
has O
deployed O
malware O
to O
targets O
using O
several O
novel B-ACT
methods I-ACT
. O

For O
years O
, O
Turla B-APT
has O
relied O
, O
among O
other O
impersonations O
, O
on O
fake B-TOOL
Flash I-TOOL
installers I-TOOL
to O
compromise O
victims O
. O

Turla B-APT
merely O
uses O
the O
Adobe O
brand O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
downloading O
the O
malware O
. O

By O
looking O
at O
our O
telemetry O
, O
we O
found O
evidence O
that O
Turla B-APT
installers O
were O
exfiltrating O
information O
to O
get.adobe.com B-DOM

since O
at O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
they O

be O
as O
stealthy O
as O
possible O
by O
hiding O

Our O
January B-TIME

white O
paper O
was O
the O
first O
public O
analysis O
of O
a O
Turla B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
called O
Mosquito B-ACT
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-APT
has O
used O
generic B-TOOL
tools I-TOOL
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source B-TOOL
password I-TOOL
dumpers I-TOOL
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-TOOL
. O

Starting O
in O
March B-TIME
2018 I-TIME
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign B-ACT
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation B-ACT
framework O
Metasploit B-TOOL
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito O
backdoor O
. O

Even O
an O
experienced O
user O
can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious B-FILE
file I-FILE
that O
is O
apparently O
from O
adobe.com B-DOM
, O
since O
the O
URL O
and O
the O
IP O
address O
correspond O
to O
Adobe O

legitimate O
infrastructure O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-APT
has O
used O
Metasploit B-TOOL
as O
a O
first O
stage O
backdoor O
, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O
tools O
such O
as O
Skipper B-MAL
. O

Traffic O
was O
intercepted O
on O
a O

between O
the O

machine O
and O
the O

, O
allowing O
Turla B-APT

operators O
to O
replace B-ACT
the I-ACT
legitimate I-ACT
Flash I-ACT
executable I-ACT
with O
a O
trojanized O
version O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
March B-TIME
2018 I-TIME
, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O
tracking O
of O
Turla B-APT
's O
activities B-ACT
, O
we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O
Mosquito B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
. O

In O
this O
post O
, O
we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla B-ACT
Mosquito I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Primary O
targets O
for O
this O
adversary O
are O
in O
the O
government B-IDTY
, O
aerospace B-IDTY
, O
NGO B-IDTY
, O
defense B-IDTY
, O
cryptology B-IDTY
and O
education B-IDTY
sectors I-IDTY
. O

Turla B-APT
's O
campaign B-ACT
still O
relies O
on O
a O
fake O
Flash O
installer O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
directly O
dropping O
the O
two O
malicious O
DLLs O
, O
it O
executes O
a O
Metasploit B-TOOL
shellcode I-TOOL
and I-TOOL
drops I-TOOL
, O
or O
downloads O
from O
Google O
Drive O
, O
a O
legitimate O
Flash O
installer O
. O

The O
Turla B-APT
espionage B-ACT
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Carbon B-MAL
, O
a O
second O
stage O
backdoor O
in O
the O
Turla B-APT
group O
arsenal O
. O

The O
Turla B-APT
group O
is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O
stages O
, O
first O
doing O
reconnaissance B-ACT
on O
their O
victims' B-IDTY
systems I-IDTY
before O
deploying O
their O
most O
sophisticated B-ACT
tools I-ACT
such O
as O
Carbon B-MAL
. O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM

Reporting I-SECTEAM
subscription I-SECTEAM
, O
customers O
received O
an O
update O
in O
mid-February B-TIME
2017 B-TIME
. O

Like O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
activity I-ACT
, O
WhiteBear B-MAL
leverages O
compromised B-ACT
websites I-ACT
and O
hijacked O
satellite O
connections O
for O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 B-TOOL
) O
infrastructure O
. O

WhiteBear B-MAL
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
Skipper B-TOOL
Turla I-APT
cluster O
of O
activity B-ACT
documented O
in O
another O
private O
intelligence O
report O
" O
Skipper B-TOOL
Turla I-APT
the O
White B-MAL
Atlas I-TOOL
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 B-TIME
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-MAL
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February B-TIME
to O
September B-TIME
2016 I-TIME
, O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity I-ACT
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies B-IDTY
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity I-ACT
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related B-IDTY
organizations I-IDTY
into O
June B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-MAL
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies B-IDTY
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-APT
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails B-ACT
sent O
by O
the O
German B-IDTY
Foreign I-IDTY
Office I-IDTY
staff I-IDTY
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla B-APT
operators O
for O
this O
campaign B-ACT
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft O
Outlook O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The O
Bat! O
, O
a O
mail O
client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla B-APT
steals O
emails B-ACT
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails B-ACT
to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European B-IDTY
governments I-IDTY
and O
defense B-IDTY
companies I-IDTY
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-FILE
documents I-TOOL
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 B-TIME
, O
multiple O
media B-IDTY
claimed O
that O
Turla B-APT
operators O
used O
mail B-ACT
attachments I-ACT
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate B-ACT
and I-ACT
exfiltrate I-ACT
emails I-ACT
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla B-APT
is O
the O
only O
espionage B-ACT
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails B-ACT
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-FILE
attachments I-TOOL
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla B-APT
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar B-MAL
, O
which O
is O
a O
Trojan O
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET O
Framework O
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-TOOL
tool I-TOOL
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla B-APT
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos B-APT
and O
Snake B-APT
) O
, O
who O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
compromised O
embassies B-IDTY
, O
defense B-IDTY
contractors I-IDTY
, O
educational B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
, O
and O
research B-IDTY
organizations I-IDTY
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured B-TOOL
backdoor I-MAL
controlled O
by O
email B-ACT
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla B-APT
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla B-APT
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code B-ACT
lineage I-ACT
in O
Kazuar B-MAL
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 B-TIME
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla B-APT
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar B-MAL
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon B-MAL
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
tools O
such O
as O
NoFuserEx B-TOOL
, O
ConfuserEx B-TOOL
Fixer I-TOOL
, O
ConfuserEx B-TOOL
Switch I-TOOL
Killer I-TOOL
, O
and O
de4d0t B-TOOL
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O
the O
code O
for O
in O
depth O
analysis O
. O

Kazuar B-SECTEAM
generates B-ACT
its I-ACT
mutex I-ACT
by O
using O
a O
process O
that O
begins O
with O
obtaining O
the O
MD5 B-ENCR
hash O
of O
a O
string O
" O
[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex O
" O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
against O
private B-IDTY
companies I-IDTY
. O

e O
uncovered O
the O
activity B-ACT
of O
a O
hacking B-ACT
group O
which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API B-ACT
access I-ACT
, O
Turla B-APT
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump B-ACT
data I-ACT
to O
and O
exfiltrate B-ACT
data I-ACT
from O
. O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O
and O
specializes O
in O
cyberattacks B-ACT
against O
the O
online B-IDTY
video I-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
threat O
actors O
may O
compile O
Windows B-OS
and O
Unix B-OS
based O
payloads O
using O
the O
same O
code O
to O
deploy O
Kazuar B-SECTEAM
against O
both O
platforms O
. O

The O
group O

main O
objective O
is O
to O
steal B-ACT

APT5 B-APT
has O
targeted O

organizations O
across O

but O
its O
focus O
appears O
to O

on O

both O

APT5 O
breached O
the O

The O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O

the O

The O

related O

an O

While O

However O
, O
to O

so O
even O

Our O
direct O
observation O

in-the-wild O
spearphishing B-ACT

Bahamut B-APT

the O

were O
seen O
in O

an O

a O

Once O
inside O

the O
ultimate O
goal O

Bahamut B-APT

not O
only O
maintaining O

running B-ACT

although O
the O

In O

, O
in O

employing O
the O

as O
before O

Our O
primary O
contribution O

is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut B-APT
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O

and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O

a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O

As O
we O

then O
, O
compared O
to O

though O
it O
were O
a O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut B-APT
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform B-IDTY
providers I-IDTY
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-APT
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support B-ACT
of I-IDTY
its I-ACT
espionage I-ACT
activities I-ACT
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O

or O
bundle O

with O
legitimate B-TOOL
software I-TOOL
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-APT
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing B-ACT
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O

provide O
more I-ACT

Bahamut B-APT

have O
also O

These O

did O

We O

operating O
outside O

although O
this O
narrow O

could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-APT

have O
appeared O

are O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
used O
in O

Bookworm B-MAL

functional O
code O
is O
radically O
different O

has O
a O
rather O
unique O
modular O
architecture O
that O
warranted O
additional O
analysis O
by O
Unit B-SECTEAM
42 I-SECTEAM
. O

Bookworm B-MAL
has O
little O
malicious O
functionality O
built-in O
, O
with O
its O
only O
core O
ability O
involving O
stealing B-ACT
keystrokes B-IDTY
and O
clipboard B-IDTY
contents I-IDTY

The O
Plead B-MAL

a O

, O
according O
to O

Micro I-SECTEAM
, O
is O
used O
by O
the O
BlackTech B-APT
group O
in O
targeted B-ACT

So O
far O
, O
it O
appears O
threat O
actors O
have O
deployed O
the O
Bookworm B-TOOL
Trojan I-MAL
primarily O
in O
attacks B-ACT
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand B-LOC
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
use O
a O
commercial O
installation O
tool O
called O
Smart B-TOOL
Installer I-TOOL
Maker I-TOOL
to O
encapsulate O
and O
execute O
a O
self-extracting B-TOOL

then O
executes O
the O
legitimate O

. O

targeted B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
. O

Using O
XREFs B-TOOL
during O
static O
analysis O
is O
a O
common O
technique O
to O
quickly O
find B-ACT
where I-ACT
functions I-ACT
of I-IDTY
interest I-ACT
are O
called O
. O

The O
developers O
designed O
Bookworm B-MAL
to O
be O
a O
modular B-TOOL
Trojan I-MAL
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O
architecture O
of O
the O
Trojan O
, O
as O
Bookworm B-MAL
can O
also O
load O
additional O
modules O
provided O
by O
the O
C2 B-TOOL
server O
. O

Although O
the O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-MAL
have O
included O
only O
keylogging B-ACT
functionality O
in O
Bookworm B-MAL
as O
a O
core O
ability O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
several O
of O
the O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
Leader I-ACT
with O
cryptographic B-ENCR
functions I-ENCR
and O
hashing B-ENCR
functions I-ENCR
, O
while O
others O
support O
Leader B-MAL

ability O

communicate O
with O
its O
C2 B-TOOL

While O
we O
did O
not O
discuss O
the O
surrounding B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
using O
Bookworm B-MAL
in O
detail O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
threat O
actors O
deploying O
Bookworm B-MAL
primarily O
in O
attacks B-ACT
on O

in O
Thailand B-LOC

Also O
, O
Bookworm B-MAL
uses O
a O
combination O
of O
encryption O
and O
compression O
algorithms O
to O
obfuscate B-ACT
the I-ACT
traffic I-ACT
between O
the O
system O
and O
C2 B-TOOL

. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-MAL
have O
gone O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
create O
a O
modular O
framework O
that O
is O
very O
flexible O
through O
its O
ability O

run O
additional O

recently O
published O
a O
blog O
on O
a O
newly O
identified O
Trojan O
called O
Bookworm B-MAL
, O
which O
discussed O
the O
architecture O
and O
capabilities O
of O
the O
malware O
and O
alluded O
to O
Thailand B-LOC
being O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
threat O

Leader B-MAL

Bookworm B-MAL

main O
module O
and O
controls O
all O
of O
the O
activities B-ACT
of O
the O
Trojan B-MAL
, O
but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O
DLLs B-FILE
to O
provide O
specific O
functionality O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-MAL
use O
these O
modules O
in O
a O
rather O
unique O
way O
, O
as O
the O
other O
embedded B-FILE
DLLs I-FILE
provide O
API O
functions O
for O
Leader B-MAL
to O
carry O
out O
its O
tasks O
. O

Unit B-SECTEAM
42 I-SECTEAM
does O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
for O
all O
known O
Bookworm B-TOOL
samples I-MAL

but O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
attempted O
attacks B-ACT
on O
at O
least O
two O
branches O
of O
government B-IDTY
in O
Thailand O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks B-ACT
delivering O
Bookworm B-MAL
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand B-LOC
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
associated O
decoys B-FILE
documents I-FILE

as O
well O
as O
several O
of O
the O
dynamic B-TOOL

host O
C2 B-TOOL

that O
contain O
the O
words O
" O
Thai B-LOC
" O
or O
" O
Thailand B-LOC
" O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O
actors O
will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm B-MAL
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm B-MAL
as O
a O
payload O
in O
attacks B-ACT
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand B-LOC
. O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O
systems O
seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-TOOL
C2 I-TOOL
servers I-TOOL
also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O
with O
a O
majority O
of O
systems O
existing O
within O
Thailand B-LOC
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm B-MAL
, O
the O
Trojan B-MAL
sends B-ACT
a O
static I-ACT
date I-ACT
string I-ACT
to O
the O
C2 B-TOOL
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-TOOL
code I-TOOL
to O
track O
their O
attack B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier I-ACT
for O
the O
Trojan O
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
hardcoded I-FILE
into O
each O
Bookworm B-TOOL
sample I-TOOL
as O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier I-ACT
. O

A O
Trojan O
sending O
a O
build B-ACT
identifier I-ACT
to O
its O
C2 B-TOOL
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date B-FILE
codes I-FILE
are O
used O
for O
campaign B-ACT
tracking I-ACT
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-MAL
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-TOOL
samples I-MAL
use O
the I-ACT
static I-ACT
date I-ACT
string I-ACT
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack B-ACT
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
. O

Another O

however O
their O
first O

only O
detected O
in O
August B-TIME

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O

. O

Buhtrap B-APT
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network B-ACT
worm I-ACT
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank B-IDTY
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan B-ACT

then O
the O

the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing B-ACT
email I-ACT
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap B-APT
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses B-IDTY
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing B-ACT
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap B-APT
add O
strategic B-ACT
web I-ACT
compromises I-ACT
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-TOOL
downloader I-TOOL
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October B-TIME
26th I-TIME
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe B-FILE
or O
AmmyySvc.exe B-FILE
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-APT
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-TOOL
websites I-TOOL
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-TOOL
banking I-MAL
trojan I-TOOL
, O
Buhtrap B-APT
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian B-LOC
banks B-IDTY
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
to O
steal B-ACT
money I-ACT
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses B-IDTY
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-IDTY
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants B-IDTY
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap B-APT
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 B-TIME
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-TOOL
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial B-IDTY
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing B-ACT
money I-ACT
from O
Russian B-LOC
financial B-IDTY
establishments I-IDTY
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap B-APT
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 B-TIME
in O
the O
TwoBee B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 B-TIME
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap B-APT
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-TOOL
Trojan I-MAL
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap B-APT
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news B-IDTY
outlets I-IDTY
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning B-ACT
off I-ACT
assets I-ACT
in I-ACT
transactions I-ACT
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign B-ACT
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting B-IDTY
departments I-IDTY
in O
Russian O
businesses B-IDTY
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O
" O
accountant O
" O
in O
Russian B-LOC
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign B-ACT
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak B-MAL
Carbanak B-MAL
documented O
by O
Fox-IT B-SECTEAM
and O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz B-TOOL
application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-TOOL
remote I-TOOL
access I-TOOL
tool I-TOOL
, O
changes O
system O
settings O
to O
allow O
concurrent O

and O
so O
on O

The O

. O

In O
addition O
to O
built-in O
functionalities O
, O
the O
operators O
of O
Careto B-MAL
can O
upload B-ACT
additional I-ACT
modules I-ACT
which O
can O
perform O
any O
malicious O
task O
. O

Careto B-MAL
's O
Mask B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
we O
discovered O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing B-ACT
e-mails I-ACT
with O
links O
to O
a O
malicious O
website O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
attackers O
use O
sub-domains B-DOM
on O
the O
exploit O
websites O
, O
to O
make O
them O
seem O
more O
legitimate O
. O

These O
sub-domains O
simulate O
sub-sections O
of O
the O
main O

in O
Spain B-LOC
plus O
some O
international O
ones O
like O
the O

and O
the O

. O

The O
CVE-2012-0773 B-VULID
was O
originally O
discovered O
by O
VUPEN O
and O
has O
an O
interesting O
story O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
attackers O
attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
attempting O
to O
exploit O
Kaspersky B-TOOL
Lab I-TOOL

. O

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O

when O
we O
observed O

in O
our O

to O

Most O

were O
created O
in O
2012 B-TIME
. O

The O

began O
taking O
them O
offline O
in O
January B-TIME
2014 I-TIME
. O

Last O

we O
discussed O

, O
a O

also O

known O
to O
the O

have O
a O
strong O
affinity O
for O
PHP O

this O
is O
relatively O
unique O
amongst O

who O
often O
favor O
targeting O
a O
specific O
individual B-IDTY
at O
a O

. O

Clever B-APT
Kitten I-APT
primarily O
targets O
global O
companies O
with O
strategic O
importance O
to O
countries O
that O
are O
contrary O
to O
Iranian O
interests O
. O

A O
Clever B-ACT
Kitten I-ACT
attack I-ACT
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
web B-TOOL
vulnerability I-TOOL
scanner I-TOOL
to O
conduct O

. O

The O
scanner O
was O
identified O
as O

is O
a O
commercial O

Once O

will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote B-IDTY
access I-IDTY
to O
the O

. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O

against O

browsers O
, O
which O
for O
a O

This O

is O
a O
longer O

the I-ACT

In O
2013 B-TIME
, O
Rapid7 B-SECTEAM
reported O
on O
a O
series O
of O
relatively O
amateur O
attacks B-ACT
against O
Pakistani O
targets O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MAL
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O
attacks B-ACT
associated O
with O
a O
backdoor B-ACT

method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-MAL
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell B-MAL
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 B-SECTEAM
in O
2013 B-TIME
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MAL
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-FILE
binary I-FILE
files I-FILE
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
executable I-MAL
is O
disguised B-ACT

using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override B-TOOL
( O
RTLO B-TOOL
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false B-ACT

. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity B-ACT
have O
links O
to O
attacks B-ACT
with O
likely O
Indian B-LOC
origins I-LOC
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL B-MAL

the O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover B-APT
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O

Since O

a O

some O

It O
wasn't O
until O
August B-TIME

that O
we O
observed O
something O
which O
made O
us O
wonder O
if O

The O
Cloud O
Atlas O

utilize O
a O
rather O
unusual O
C&C B-ACT
mechanism I-ACT
. O

We O
named O
it O
RedOctober O
because O
we O
started O
this O
investigation O
in O
October B-TIME
2012 I-TIME

an O
unusually O

This O

, O
particularly O
the O
IT B-IDTY
security O
specialists O
in O
companies O
and O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks B-ACT
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS B-IDTY
software O
was O
installed O
in O

to O
start O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk B-MAL
. O

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian B-LOC
cybercriminal I-LOC
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity B-ACT
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia B-LOC
, O
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial B-ACT
theft I-ACT
via O
attacks B-ACT
on O
RBS B-IDTY

In O
April B-TIME
2013 I-TIME
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-TOOL
module I-TOOL
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks B-ACT
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks B-IDTY
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded B-ACT
additional I-ACT
modules I-ACT
, O
including O
ones O
allowing B-ACT
for O
the I-ACT
automatic I-ACT

changing B-ACT

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 B-TIME
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O

seriously O
reduced O

this O

named O
MoonWind B-MAL

We O
chose O
the O
name O

based O
on O
debugging O

we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O

the O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-TOOL
Thai I-TOOL
websites I-TOOL
to O
host B-ACT
the I-ACT
malware I-ACT

which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O

used O
in O
the O

Both O
the O

The O

control I-TOOL
servers I-TOOL
( O
C2s B-TOOL

for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks B-ACT
together O
using O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-MAL
samples I-MAL
using O
the O

a O
different O

legitimate B-TOOL

The O
attacks B-ACT
in O
that O

took O

in O
late O

the O

We O
were O
not O

the O

again O
compromised O
a O

in O
this O
case O
the O

It O
is O

another O

the O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
some O
previous O
targeted B-ACT

attacks I-ACT
, O
the O
attackers O
in O
this O
incident O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
services O
like O

establish B-ACT
free I-ACT
subdomains I-ACT
in O
their O

. O

Blending O

is O
a O
common O
tactic O

by O

to O
help O

Based O
on O
the O
patterns O
of O
subdomain O

over O

TRAC B-SECTEAM
believes O
this O

an O

the O

registered O
their O

the O

convenience O
( O

to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
an O

we O
call O

due O
to O
a O

. O

We O
encountered O

In O

The O

the O
ongoing O
use O
of O
these O
four O

in O
a O

against O
not O

also O
others O

The O
malware O
samples O
deployed O
in O
both O
of O
these O
operations O
are O
updated O
versions O
of O
the O
KeyBoy B-MAL
backdoor I-MAL
first O
discussed O
in O
2013 B-TIME
by O

. O

This O
behavioural O
tactic O
was O
previously O
mentioned O
in O
relation O
to O
KeyBoy B-MAL
in O
a O
2013 B-TIME
blog O
post O
by O
Cisco B-SECTEAM
. O

These O
versions O
of O
KeyBoy B-MAL
differed O
from O
the O
one O
first O
described O
by O

in O
several O
ways O
, O
many O
of O
which O
will O
be O
described O
in O

These O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 B-TIME
, O
2015 B-TIME
, O
and O
2016 B-TIME
KeyBoy B-MAL
samples I-MAL
provide O
evidence O
of O
a O
development O
effort O
focused O
on O
changing O
components O
that O
would O
be O
used O
by O
researchers O
to O
develop B-ACT

In O
another O

( O

Trend B-SECTEAM
Micro I-SECTEAM
specifically O
noted O
that O
the O
2013 B-TIME
versions O
of O

used O
the O
same O

for O
encoding O
their O
configuration O

as O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
Operation B-ACT
Tropic I-ACT

This O
sample O
was O
also O
found O
to O
be O
deployed O
using O
the O
CVE-2012-0158 B-VULID
vulnerability O
. O

The O
operation O
against O
the O
Tibetan B-IDTY
Parliamentarians I-IDTY
illustrates O
the O
continued O
use O
of O
malicious B-FILE
attachments I-FILE
in O
the O
form O
of O

bearing I-TOOL
exploits I-TOOL
. O

Chances O
are O
about O
even O
, O
though O
, O
that O
Mofang B-APT
is O
a O
relevant O
threat O
actor O
to O
any O
organization O
that O
invests O
in O
Myanmar B-LOC
or O
is O
otherwise O
politically B-IDTY
involved O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
campaign B-ACT
in O
Myanmar B-LOC
, O
Mofang B-APT
has O
been O
observed O
to O
attack O

across O
multiple O
sectors O
( O
government B-IDTY

This O
threat O
report O
gives O
insight O
into O
some O
of O
the O
information O
that O
Fox-IT B-SECTEAM
has O
about O
a O
threat O
actor O
that O
it O
follows O
, O
called O
Mofang B-APT
. O

The O
name O
Mofang B-APT
is O
based O
on O
the O
Mandarin O
verb O
, O
which O
means O
to O
imitate O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-APT
group I-APT
is O
a O
group O
that O
operates O
out O
of O
China B-LOC
and O
is O
probably O
government-affiliated O
. O

The O
Mofang B-APT

Attacks B-ACT
on O
the O
chemical B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack B-ACT
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect B-ACT
intellectual B-IDTY
property I-IDTY
such O
as O
design O
documents O
, O
formulas O
, O
and O
manufacturing O
processes O
. O

The O
attack B-ACT
wave O
started O
in O
late O
July B-TIME
2011 I-TIME
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 B-TIME
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks B-ACT
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage B-ACT
, O
collecting B-ACT
intellectual B-IDTY
property I-IDTY
for O
competitive O
advantage O
. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O

industry I-IDTY
in O
late O
May B-TIME
. O

From O
late O
April O

Attackers O
then O
moved O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
against O
the O
chemical B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
began O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O
desired O
targets O
and O
then O
sent O
an O
email B-ACT
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious B-ACT
emails I-ACT
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O

were O
being O

a O
broad O
set O
of O

, O
the O

The O
attacks B-ACT
were O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
computer O

that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O

which O
use O

Operation B-ACT
Ghoul I-ACT
is O
one O
of O
the O
many O
attacks B-ACT
in O
the O

targeting O
industrial B-IDTY

to O
be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O
and O
opening O

. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-ACT
Groundbait I-ACT
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks B-ACT
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government B-IDTY
separatists I-IDTY
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks B-ACT
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high B-IDTY
profile I-IDTY
organizations I-IDTY
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks B-ACT
is O
clearly O
espionage B-ACT
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 B-TIME
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
North B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
( O
MENA B-LOC
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks B-ACT
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing B-ACT
attack I-ACT
that O
targeted O
political B-IDTY
figures O
in O
the O
MENA B-LOC

of O
other O
CIS O

including O
Russia B-LOC

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O
in O

detections O
in O
2014 B-TIME

2015 B-TIME
were O

The O
first O
Potao B-ACT

In O
March B-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, O
the O
gang O
behind O
Potao B-MAL
started O
using O
a O
new O
infection B-TOOL

Since O
March B-TIME
2015 I-TIME
, O

In O
September B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
, O
we O
discovered O
Silence B-ACT
attack I-ACT
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing B-ACT
email I-ACT
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-ACT
attack I-ACT
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking B-IDTY
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing B-ACT
emails I-ACT
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O
bank B-IDTY
employees I-IDTY
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

The O
spear-phishing B-ACT
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
way O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns B-ACT
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack B-ACT
is O
Silence O
group O
, O
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O
mid-2016 B-TIME

A O

as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O

that O

that O

the O
Russian B-LOC

As O

the O

runs O
several O

useful O

for O
its O

The O
intelligence O
we O
have O
collected O
shows O
that O
Silence O
is O
part O
of O
a O
more O
extensive O
operation O
, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
operating O
mainly O
on O
Russian O

These O
spearphishing B-ACT
attempts O
represent O
an O
evolution O
of O
Iranian O
actors O
based O
on O
their O
social B-ACT

tactics I-ACT

narrow O

Based O
on O
file O
modification O
dates O

of O

, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
observed O

was O
initiated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
February B-TIME
2016 I-TIME
, O
with O

While O

, O
the O

Samples O

contained O
the O

several O

In O

The O

this O

These O

provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O
entities O
behind O
the O

are O
Persian-language O

due O
to O
the O

For O

to O

A O
previous O

of O
this O

was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos B-SECTEAM
in O
June B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O
operation O
was O
seen O
in O
the O

. O

ined O
in O
the O

DriverInstallerU.exe B-FILE

its O

that O
its O
original O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O

, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
Bisonal B-APT
look O
for O
victims B-IDTY
who I-IDTY
answer I-IDTY
well-defined O
characteristics O

believe O
that O
further O

delivered O
only O

those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O

In O
this O

however O

the O

, O
thanks O
to O
the O
Bisonal B-APT
known O
affection O
for O
decoy B-ACT

that O
pose O

we O
were O
able O
to O

the O

With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT B-ACT
attack I-ACT
that O
began O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O

, O
over O
a O

These O
unknown B-APT
actors I-APT
continued O
launching O

over O
the O

For O
simplicity O
, O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
is O
calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy I-APT

BlackEnergy B-APT
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O

the O
current O
attacks O

indicate O
that O

on O
their O

in O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM

continue O

the O
BlackEnergy B-APT
attacks O
in O

update O
our O

more O
data O
when O

From O
Buhtrap B-APT
perpetrating O
cybercrime O
for O

its O

been O
expanded O

Throughout O
our O

we've B-SECTEAM

this B-APT
group I-APT
deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor B-ACT
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O
victims O

but O
June B-TIME
2019 I-TIME
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap B-APT
group O
use O
a O
zero-day B-ACT
exploit I-ACT
as O
part O
of O
a O

In O
that O
case O

we O
observed O
Buhtrap B-APT

CVE-2019-1132 B-VULID

against O

However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O

occurred O
before O
the O

we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

people O
behind O
the O

attacks O
against O

When O

was O
targeting O

, O
the O
decoy O

would O
typically O
be O

The O

When O
the O

shifted O
to O

the O

The O
diagram O
below O
illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-FILE
Turtle I-FILE
campaign O
used O
DNS B-PROT
hijacking I-ACT
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O
. O

As O
of O
early B-TIME
2019 I-TIME
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing B-ACT
it B-APT
vector I-APT
came O
from O
a O
compromised O
organization's O
public O
disclosure O
. O

On O
January O
4 O
, O
Packet O
Clearing O
House O
, O
which O
is O
not O
an O
Internet O
exchange O
point O
but O
rather O
is O
an O
NGO O
which O
provides O
support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O
name O
system O
, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
it B-APT
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS B-PROT
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked B-ACT
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
it B-APT
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS B-PROT
server I-ACT
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS B-PROT
queries O
. O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
it B-APT
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-TOOL
servers I-TOOL
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture B-ACT
user B-IDTY
credentials I-IDTY
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-TOOL
server I-TOOL
IP O
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos B-SECTEAM
identified O
16 O
additional B-TOOL
servers I-TOOL
leveraged O
by O
the O
it B-APT
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O

The O
it B-APT
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-ACT
operations I-ACT
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled B-APT
servers B-TOOL
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' B-APT
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-TOOL
applications I-TOOL
, O
such O
as O
Cisco O
Adaptive B-TOOL
Security I-TOOL
Appliance I-TOOL
(ASA) B-TOOL
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we B-SECTEAM
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
actors' B-APT
found O
a O
new O
ASA B-VULNAME
exploit B-VULNAME
. O

Rather O
, O
they O
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's B-TOOL
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN B-TOOL
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS B-PROT
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O
domain O
resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled B-APT
MitM B-TOOL
server I-TOOL
. O

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
actor-controlled B-APT
were O
able O
to O
compromise B-ACT
NetNod I-ACT
, O
a O
non-profit O
, O
independent O
internet O

organization O
based O
in O
Sweden B-LOC
. O

Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actor-controlled B-APT
were O
able O
to O
manipulate B-ACT
the O
DNS B-PROT
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O

This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
actor-controlled B-APT
to O
harvest B-ACT
credentials B-IDTY
of O

who O
manage O

with O
the O
TLD O

In O
one O
of O
the O
more O
recent O
campaigns B-ACT

2019 O
, O
the O
actor-controlled B-APT
actors I-APT
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based O

Cafax B-IDTY
. O

We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle I-ACT
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O
access O
to O
the O
NetNod B-IDTY

, O
which O
was O
previously O
compromised O
by O
this O
actor-controlled B-APT
actor I-APT

Obtaining B-ACT
access I-ACT
to O
this O
ccTLD B-TOOL

would O
have O
allowed O
actor-controlled B-APT
to O
hijack B-ACT
any O

that O
used O

These O
actor-controlled B-APT

Once O
they O
have O
access B-ACT
to I-ACT
the I-ACT
network I-ACT
, O
they O
steal B-ACT
the O
organization's B-FILE
legitimate I-FILE
SSL I-FILE
certificate I-FILE
and O
use O
it O
on O
actor-controlled B-TOOL

We B-SECTEAM
believe O
that O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
continues O
to O
be O
highly O
successful O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Had O
more O
ccTLDs B-ACT
implemented O

such O
as O

, O
Sea B-APT
would O
be O
unable O

allowing O
the O

The O
Sea B-APT

were O
able O
to O
maintain B-ACT
long O

many O
of O
these O

If O

suggest O
that O
the O

Operation B-APT
Parliament I-APT
appears O
to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O
tensions O
in O
the O

The O
Operation B-APT

imitating B-ACT

With O
deception O

false O

increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O
Operation B-APT
actors I-APT
, O
attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

The O
malware B-MAL
was O
first O

packed O
with O
VMProtect B-TOOL
when O
unpacked O
the O

didnt O
show O
any O

The O
malware B-MAL
starts O
communicating B-ACT

server O
by O
sending O
basic B-IDTY
information I-IDTY
about O

The O

basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-TOOL

enabling O

to O
execute B-ACT
scripts/commands I-ACT

via O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O
phishing B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
designed O
to O
steal B-ACT

spy B-ACT

seemingly O
involved O

We O
refer O

this O

Operation B-APT

Malik O
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
written O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December B-TIME
2016 I-TIME
, O
Amnesty O
International O
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O
social O
engineering O
campaign O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
seemingly O
fake O
human O

organization O
known O
as O
Voiceless B-APT

which O
targeted O
international O
human O

campaigning O
on O

in O
Qatar B-LOC

It O
appears O
that O
the O
Voiceless B-APT
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O

and O
stole B-ACT

construct B-ACT
the I-ACT

along O

stolen O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O

, O
the O
Voiceless B-APT
Safeena O
then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
invitations B-ACT

access O
several O

The O
Voiceless B-APT

meticulous O

Among O
the O

of O
this O

the O
International O

Both O
in O
the O

sometimes O
over O
a O
period O

several O

This O
time O
the O

be O
about O
the O

was O
seemingly O

While O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
underlying O
Qatar B-LOC

Operation B-APT
Sheep I-APT
, O
it O
is O
also O
hypothetically O

We B-SECTEAM
believe O
the O
iOS B-MAL
malware I-MAL
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O

it O
is O
very O
similar O

We B-SECTEAM
found O
two O
malicious O
iOS O

. O

One O
is O
called O
XAgent B-MAL
detected O
as O
IOS_XAGENT.A B-FILE

the O
other O
one O
uses O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
iOS O

, O
MadCap B-MAL
detected O
as O
IOS_ O
XAGENT.B B-FILE

The O
obvious O
goal O
of O
the O
SEDNIT-related B-APT
spyware B-MAL
is O
to O
steal B-ACT
personal B-IDTY

, O
record O

, O
make O
screenshots O
, O
and O
send O
them O
to O
a O
remote O

. O

Madcap B-MAL
is O
similar O
to O
the O
XAgent B-MAL
malware O
, O
but O
the O
former O
is O
focused O
on O
recording O

The O
dropper B-ACT
first O
appeared O
in O
mid-July B-TIME
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
APT O
activity O
is O
potentially O
ongoing O
, O
with O
Turla B-APT
actively O
targeting O
G20 B-IDTY
participants O
and/or O
those O
with O
interest O
in O
the O
G20 O
, O
including O
member O
nations O
, O
journalists O
, O
and O
policymakers O
. O

Turla B-APT
is O
a O
well-documented O
, O
long O
operating O
APT O
group O
that O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
Russian B-LOC
state-sponsored B-IDTY
organization O
. O

Turla B-APT
is O
perhaps O
most O
notoriously O
suspected O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Command O
in O
2008 B-ACT
. O

More O
recently O
Turla B-APT
was O
accused O
of O
breaching B-ACT
RUAG B-IDTY
, O
a O
Swiss O
technology O
company O
, O
in O
a O
public O
report O
published O
by O

The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
in O
this O
instance O
is O
currently O
unknown O
as O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper I-MAL
has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint B-SECTEAM
researchers O
on O
a O
public O
malware O
repository O
. O

Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
ways O
it O
may O
have O
been O
delivered O
including O
some O
of O
Turlas B-APT
previous O
attack O
methods O
such O
as O
spear B-ACT
phishing I-ACT
or O
via O
a O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
. O

This O
could O
include O
diplomats B-IDTY
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O

related O
to O

Digital O
Economy O
Task O

Turla's B-APT
goal O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital B-IDTY
Economy I-IDTY
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists O
. O

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper I-MAL
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
dropper I-MAL
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript B-MAL
(JS) I-FILE
dropper I-MAL
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-MAL
dropper I-MAL
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS B-MAL
decryptor I-MAL
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint B-SECTEAM
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-MAL
payload I-FILE
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating B-ACT
files B-FILE
to O
the O
C&C B-TOOL
as O
well O
as O
downloading B-ACT
files B-FILE
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial B-ACT
reconnaissance I-ACT
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turlas B-APT
more O
fully O
featured O
implants O
. O

Turla B-APT
is O
a O
complex O
cyberattack O
platform O
focused O
predominantly O
on O

it O
after O
a O
vegetable; O
the O
.NET B-MAL

developers O
named O
it O
Topinambour B-MAL
themselves O

The O
role O
of O
the O

is O
to O
deliver O
the O
known O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
JavaScript I-MAL
Trojan I-MAL
. O

Moreover O
, O
Turla B-APT
now O
also O
has O
a O
heavily O
obfuscated B-ACT
PowerShell I-ACT
Trojan I-ACT
that O
is O
similar O
to O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
. O

as O
the O

These O
could O
be O
tools O

These O
campaign-related O

are O
located O
in O
South B-LOC

The O
tool O
does O
all O
that O
a O
typical O

needs O
to O
accomplish: O
upload B-ACT
, O
download B-ACT
and O
execute B-ACT
files B-FILE
, O
fingerprint B-ACT
target B-IDTY
systems I-IDTY
. O

The O
PowerShell B-TOOL
version O
of O
the O
Trojan B-MAL
also O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
get B-ACT
screenshots I-ACT
. O

The O
Trojan B-MAL
is O
quite O
similar O
to O
the O
.NET B-MAL
RocketMan I-MAL
Trojan I-MAL
and O
can O
handle O
the O
same O
commands; O
additionally O
, O
it O
includes O
the O
#screen O
command O
to O
take O
a O

The O
usage O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
, O
a O
well-known O
and O
exclusive O
artefact O
previously O
used O
by O
the O

makes O
us O
attribute O
this O

with O
high O
confidence O

it O
very O
matter-of-factly: O

Winnti B-APT
takes O
a O
highly O
strategic O

possibly O
a O
crucial O

the O

Although O
APT41 B-APT
initially O

30 O

In O
2018 B-TIME

In O
June B-TIME

APT41 B-APT
sent O

although O
global B-IDTY

APT41 B-APT
continuously O
returns O

seems O
to O
have O
matured O
its O
campaigns O
through O

in O
operations O
against O
the O

We O
believe O
these O
operations O
include O
broadly O
malicious B-ACT
activity I-ACT
that O
can O
enable O
further O
operations O
, O
such O
as O
targeting O

such O
as O

In O
October B-TIME

APT41 B-APT
used O

Since O
at O

2012 B-TIME
, O
APT41 B-APT
has O
repeatedly O
gained O
access O
to O
game O

environments O
within O

including O
online B-IDTY
multiplayer I-IDTY

, O
as O

as O
targeting O

APT41 B-APT
has O
been O
observed O
inserting B-ACT

into O
legitimate O
video O

to O
distribute O

. O

In O
2018 B-TIME
, O
the O
APT41 B-APT
inserted B-ACT
CRACKSHOT I-ACT
malware I-ACT
into O
game O
files O
that O
were O
signed O
with O
legitimate O
codesigning O

, O
most O
likely O
indicating O
access O
to O
the O
production O
environment O
, O
which O
facilitated O
a O
supply O

. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT41 B-APT
limitedly O
deploy B-ACT
rootkits I-ACT

hide O
their O

and O
maintain O

on O
victim O

. O

Selective O
deployment O
of O
ROCKBOOT B-SECTEAM
suggests O
that O
APT41 B-APT
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

APT41 B-APT
has O
blatantly O
engaged O
in O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
, O
including O
manipulating O
virtual O

In O
a O
highly O
unusual O

, O
APT41 B-APT
attempted O
to O
extort O
a O

company O
by O
deploying B-ACT
the O
Encryptor O

APT41 B-APT
is O
well-known O
for O
leveraging B-ACT
compromised O
digital O
certificates O
from O
video O
game O
studios O
to O
sign O
malware O
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-APT
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O
specific O
targeted O
game O
, O
so O
the O
group O
resorted O
to O
ransomware B-ACT
to O
attempt O
to O
salvage B-ACT
their I-ACT
efforts I-ACT
and O
profit B-ACT
from O
the O
compromise O
. O

APT41 B-APT
has O
also O
used O
credentials B-ACT
compromised I-ACT
in O
previous O
operations O
. O

In O
2014 B-TIME

APT41 B-APT
compromised B-ACT
an O

Although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
first-hand O

As O
demonstrated O
in O
operations O

, O
APT41 B-APT
leverages O
a O

APT41 B-APT
is O
unique O
among O

in O
that O
it O
leverages O
non-public O

typically O

in O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
activity O
for O

During O
multiple O
engagements O
, O
APT41 B-APT
attempted O
to O
remove O

Explicit O
financially-motivated O
targeting O
is O
unusual O
among O
Chinese B-LOC
statesponsored I-LOC
threat O
groups O
, O
and O
evidence O
suggests O
APT41 B-APT
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O
crime O
and O
cyber O
espionage B-ACT
operations O
from O
2014 B-TIME
onward O
. O

APT41 B-APT
operations O
against O
higher B-IDTY
education I-IDTY
, O
travel B-IDTY
services I-IDTY
, O
and O
news/media B-IDTY
firms I-IDTY
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
APT41 B-APT
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom B-IDTY
companies B-IDTY
. O

APT41 B-APT
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare B-IDTY
, O
high-tech B-IDTY
, O
and O
telecommunications B-IDTY
sectors B-IDTY
. O

The O
groups O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
, O
where O
APT41 B-APT
has O
manipulated B-ACT
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy B-ACT
ransomware B-ACT
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 B-APT
targeted O
a O
hotels O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked B-ACT
to O
reconnoiter O
the O
facility O
for O
security O
reasons O
. O

These O
supply B-ACT
chain I-ACT
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41s B-APT
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage B-ACT
campaigns O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 B-APT
limits O
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching O
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O

Mapping O
the O
groups O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 B-APT
primarily O
conducts B-ACT
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-APT
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
groups O
later O
espionage B-ACT
operations O
. O

APT41 B-APT
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-TOOL
families I-TOOL
and O
tools B-TOOL
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage B-ACT
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-APT
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy B-ACT
additional I-ACT
malware I-ACT
. O

APT41 B-APT
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing B-ACT
emails I-ACT
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
(.chm) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 B-APT
has O
also O
deployed B-ACT
rootkits I-ACT
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 B-APT
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves B-ACT
more I-ACT
advanced I-ACT
TTPs I-ACT
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage B-ACT
operators O
, O
APT41 B-APT
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
away O
from O
direct O
intellectual B-ACT
property I-ACT
theft I-ACT
since O
2015 B-TIME
. O

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O
group's B-APT
consistent O
interest O
in O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
for O
financially O
motivated O
reasons O

Our O

In O
some O

Based O
on O

we O
believe O
this O

Based O
on O
the O

the O
various O

, O
we O
believe O
the O
Emissary B-APT
actors I-APT
breach O
the O

to O
use O
as O
a O
beachhead O
, O
then O
attempt O
to O
move B-ACT

Both O
of O
these O

During O
our O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
Emissary B-APT
uploading O
the O

, O
as O

Lastly O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
Emissary B-APT

Also O
, O
the O

The O

The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O
newly O

, O
who O
targeted O
financial B-IDTY

At O
the O

This O
is O
a O

shows O
Sednit B-APT

very O
sophisticated B-MAL

to O
conduct O
its O

. O

Three B-TIME
years I-TIME

in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC

In O
the O
past O
, O
Sednit B-APT
used O
a O
similar O
technique O
for O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
August O
2018 O
, O
the O
Sednit O

launched O
a O
spearphishing B-ACT
email I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
where O
it O
distributed O
shortened O

that O
delivered O
the O
first O

As O
we B-SECTEAM
explained O
in O
our O
most O

the O

The O
past O
iteration O
of O
SLUB B-APT
spread O
from O
a O
unique O
watering B-ACT

website O
exploiting O
CVE-2018-8174 B-VULID
, O
a O
VBScript B-TOOL
engine O
vulnerability O
. O

SLUB B-APT
used O
GitHub B-TOOL
and O
Slack B-TOOL
as O
tools O
for O
communication O
between O
the O
malware O
and O
its O

. O

On O
July B-TIME

, O
we B-SECTEAM
discovered O
a O
new O
version O
of O
SLUB B-APT
delivered O
via O
another O
unique O

Since O
we B-SECTEAM
published O
out O
last O

on O
SLUB B-APT
, O
the O
backdoor B-TOOL
has O
been O
updated O
and O
several O

. O

The O
SLUB B-APT
malware O
was O
delivered O
through O

that O
were O
injected O
with O
exploits O
for O
CVE-2018-8174 B-VULID
or O

During O
this O
attack O
, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
SLUB B-APT

The O

triggered O
the O
ZLAB B-SECTEAM
team O
to O
investigate O
its O

and O
its O
possible O

, O
discovering O
a O

of O
the O
TA505 B-APT

The O

, O
as O
stated O
by O

The O

The O

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O

, O
it O
has O
traditionally O

we O
recently O
documented O
during O
the O

of O
the O
Stealthy O

Also O
, O
some O

in O
the O

, O
such O
as O
the O
i.cmd B-FILE

, O
and O
, O
at O
the O

time O
, O
some O

for O

the O
rtegre.exe B-FILE

the O
veter1605_MAPS_10cr0.exe B-FILE

In O
2018 B-TIME
, O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs O
published O
a O
report O
that O
analyzed O
a O
Turla B-APT
PowerShell B-TOOL
loader I-TOOL
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod O
. O

Turla B-APT
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 B-TIME
, O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O
military B-IDTY
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-APT
has O
used O
PowerShell B-TOOL
in-memory O
loaders O
to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O
bypassing O
security O
products O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O
same O
scripts O
are O
used O
more O
globally O
against O
many O
traditional O
Turla B-APT
targets O
in O
Western B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
and O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

In O
some O
samples O
deployed O
since O
March B-TIME
2019 I-TIME
, O
Turla B-APT
developers O
modified O
their O
PowerShell B-TOOL
scripts O
in O
order O
to O
bypass B-ACT
the O
Antimalware O
Scan O
Interface O
(AMSI) O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
research O
, O
SWEED B-APT
which O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 B-TIME
primarily O
targets O
their O
victims O
with O
stealers O
and O
remote O
access O
trojans O
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
Turla B-APT
operators O
used O
the O
free O
email O
provider O
GMX O
again O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Outlook B-TOOL
Backdoor I-TOOL
and O
in O
LightNeuron B-MAL
. O

This O
new O
research O
confirms O
our O
forecast O
and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla B-APT
group O
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
open-source O
pen-testing O
frameworks B-TOOL
to O
conduct O
intrusion O
. O

Neptun B-MAL
is O
installed O
on O
Microsoft O
Exchange O
servers O
and O
is O
designed O
to O
passively O
listen B-ACT
for O
commands I-ACT
from O
the O
Turla B-APT
. O

One O
attack O
during O
this O
campaign O
involved O
the O
use O
of O
infrastructure O
belonging O
to O
another O
espionage B-ACT
group O
known O
as O
Crambus B-APT
aka O
OilRig B-APT
, O
APT34 B-APT
. O

Waterbug B-APT
has O
been O
using O
Meterpreter B-TOOL
since O
at O
least O
early B-TIME
2018 I-TIME
and O
, O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
used O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
Meterpreter B-TOOL
, O
which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O
extension O
in O
order O
to O
disguise O
its O
true O
purpose O
. O

In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbugs B-APT
use O
of O
Crambus B-TOOL
infrastructure I-TOOL
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbugs B-APT
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
Waterbug B-APT
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage B-ACT
group O
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victims O
network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-APT
campaigns O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O

also O
targeting O

in O
Thailand B-LOC
based O
on O
the O

string I-FILE
hardcoded I-FILE

each O

a O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O

, O
we O
believe O
the O
date B-FILE
codes I-FILE
are O
used O
for O
campaign B-ACT
tracking I-ACT
rather O
than O
a O

Another O

If O

) O
, O
then O
the O

contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O

The O

would O
install O
the O

but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O

In O
addition O
to O
built-in O

the O

Careto B-MAL

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O
Careto B-MAL
when O
we O
observed O
attempts O
to O
exploit O
a O

our O

to O
make O
the O

The O
decoy B-FILE

that O
the O

likely O
to O
be O
politically B-IDTY

been O
sending O
multiple O

. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MAL
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O
attacks B-ACT
associated O
with O
a O
backdoor B-ACT
attack I-ACT
method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-MAL
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell B-MAL
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 B-SECTEAM
in O
2013 B-TIME
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MAL
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-FILE
binary I-FILE
files I-FILE
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
executable O
is O
disguised B-ACT
as O
a O

, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override B-TOOL
( O
RTLO B-TOOL
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false B-ACT
icon I-ACT
. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity B-ACT
have O
links O
to O
attacks B-ACT
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL B-MAL
and O
the O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover B-APT
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development B-IDTY
company I-IDTY
, O
behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MAL
and O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MAL

In O
this O

we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
APT32 B-APT
group I-APT
that O
specializes O
in O
payment B-ACT

fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
APT32 B-APT
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
Labs I-SECTEAM
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise B-ACT
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
credentials B-IDTY
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O

online O
, O
hacking B-ACT
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising B-ACT
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
processing I-IDTY
devices I-IDTY
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
APT32 B-APT
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate B-ACT
further I-ACT
card I-ACT
information I-ACT
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
APT32 B-APT
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-TOOL
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove B-ACT
any I-ACT
evidence I-ACT
of O
their O
operations O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them B-FILE
using O
virtual I-ACT
private I-ACT
network I-ACT
services I-ACT
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure B-ACT
anonymity I-ACT
and O
obfuscate B-ACT
criminal I-ACT
operations I-ACT
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
APT32 B-APT
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise B-ACT
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
APT32 B-APT
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-TOOL
credentials I-TOOL
, O
personal B-TOOL
information I-TOOL
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O

These O
APT32 B-APT
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly B-ACT
access I-ACT
databases I-ACT

The O
APT32 B-APT
also O
uses O
the O

and O
SQLi O
Dumper O

(Figure O

to O
scan B-ACT

and O
exploit B-ACT
vulnerabilities I-ACT
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-TOOL
credentials I-TOOL
, O
these O
APT32 B-APT
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate B-ACT
new I-ACT
card I-ACT
numbers I-ACT
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

The O
APT32 B-APT
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create B-ACT
cloned I-ACT
physical I-ACT
cards I-ACT
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw B-ACT
funds I-ACT
from O
ATMs B-TOOL
. O

The O
APT32 B-APT
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-TOOL
606 I-TOOL
Software I-TOOL
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-TOOL
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create B-ACT
cloned I-ACT
cards I-ACT
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian B-LOC
APT32 B-APT
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen B-ACT
cards I-ACT
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O

reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O

The O
individuals B-APT
using O
Hancitor B-MAL
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O

Chanitor B-MAL
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O

in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal B-ACT

from O
their O
victims O
. O

Once O

it O
drops O
an O

Like O
many O

, O
much O
of O
APT40 B-APT

activity B-ACT
begins O
by O
attempting O
to O
trick O
targets O
with O
phishing B-ACT
emails I-ACT
, O
before O
deploying O
malware O
such O
as O
the O
Gh0st B-MAL

to O
maintain B-ACT
persistence I-ACT
on O

The O
APT40 B-APT
used O

who O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O
group O
sought O
access O
to O
these O
networks O
to O
obtain O
information O
that O
would O
enable O
it O
to O
monitor B-ACT
communications B-IDTY
passing O
through O
the O

systems I-IDTY
. O

Bahamut B-APT
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-TOOL

but O
running B-ACT
propaganda I-ACT
sites I-ACT
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities B-ACT
varied O
noticeably O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-APT
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support B-ACT
of I-IDTY
its I-ACT
espionage I-ACT
activities I-ACT
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-TOOL
software I-TOOL
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-APT
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing B-ACT
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more I-ACT
passwords I-IDTY
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-APT
's O
campaigns B-ACT
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage I-ACT
or O
information B-ACT

not O
destructive B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
or O
fraud O
. O

Once O
the O

the O

described O
above O
, O
they O
monitor O
the O
victim O

activity B-ACT

ultimately O
search O
for O

steal B-ACT
sensitive B-FILE

the I-ACT

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
to O
steal B-ACT
money I-ACT
from O
the O

of O

At O
that O

The O
Lazarus B-APT
actors I-APT
behind O
the O

were O
successful O
in O
compromising B-ACT

falsifying B-ACT

at O
various O
levels O
in O

If O
an O
Lazarus B-APT
was O
able O
to O
compromise B-ACT
an O
organization's O
network O

, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O

change B-ACT

If O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O

During O
a O
typical O

the O

provided O
actor-controlled O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-TOOL
servers I-TOOL
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture B-ACT
user B-IDTY
credentials I-IDTY

This O

allowed O
the O
Lazarus B-APT

Obtaining B-ACT
access I-ACT
to O
this O

would O
have O
allowed O

Once O
they O
have O
access B-ACT

they O
steal B-ACT

however O

after O

also O
be O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O

we O
believe O

are O
used O
for O
campaign B-ACT
tracking I-ACT
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-MAL

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-TOOL

use O
the I-ACT
static I-ACT

string I-ACT
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O

In O
both O

This O
section O
describes O
some O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
PLATINUM B-APT

The O
lack O
of O
any O
significant O
evidence O
of O

code O
between O
any O
of O
these O
backdoor O
families O
is O
another O
clue O
as O
to O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
resources O
on O
which O
the O
activity B-APT
group I-APT
is O
able O
to O
draw O
, O
and O
the O
precautions O
the O
group O
is O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
take O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
losing O
its O
ability O
to O
conduct B-ACT
its I-ACT
espionage I-ACT
operations I-ACT
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Dipsind B-MAL
and O
its O
variants O
, O
PLATINUM B-APT
uses O
a O
few O
other O
families O
of O
custom-built B-MAL
backdoors I-TOOL
within O
its O
attack O
toolset O
. O

The O
PLATINUM B-APT
group I-APT
has O
written O
a O
few O
different O
versions O
of O
keyloggers B-MAL
that O
perform O
their O
functions O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
most O
likely O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
different O
weaknesses O
in O
victims O
' O
computing O
environments O
. O

While O
one O
family O
relies O
on O
a O
small O
number O
of O
supported O
commands O
and O
simple O
shells O
, O
the O
other O
delves O
into O
more O
convoluted O
methods O
of O
injections O
, O
checks O
, O
and O
supported O
feature O
sets O
. O

Both O
PLATINUM B-APT
can O
set B-ACT
permissions I-ACT
on O
specific O

to O
Everyone O
, O
and O
work O
in O
tandem O
with O
the O
PLATINUM B-TOOL
backdoors I-TOOL
. O

In O
particular O
, O
this O
second O
PLATINUM B-APT
also O
has O
the O
capability O
of O
dumping O
users O
' O
credentials O
using O
the O
same O
technique O
employed O
by O
Mimikatz B-TOOL
. O

In O
addition O
to O
using O
several O
publicly O
known O
injection O
methods O
to O
perform O
this O
task O
, O
it O
also O
takes O
advantage O
of O
an O
obscure O
operating O
system O
feature O
known O
as O
hot O
patching O
. O

One O
of O
PLATINUM B-APT
's O
most O
recent O
and O
interesting O
tools O
is O
meant O
to O
inject O
code O
into O
processes O
using O
a O
variety O
of O
injection B-ACT
techniques I-ACT
. O

At O
a O
high O
level O
, O
hot O

can O
transparently O
apply B-ACT
patches I-ACT
to O
executables B-FILE
and O
DLLs B-FILE
in O
actively O
running O
processes O
, O
which O
does O
not O
happen O
with O
traditional O
methods O
of O
code O
injection O
such O
as O
CreateRemoteThread B-FILE
or O
WriteProcessMemory B-FILE
. O

Hot O
patching O
is O
an O
operating B-TOOL
system-supported I-TOOL
feature I-TOOL
for O
installing B-ACT
updates I-ACT
without O
having O
to O
reboot O
or O
restart O
a O

. O

Multiple O
Dipsind B-MAL
variants O
have O
been O
identified O
, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
used O
exclusively O
by O
PLATINUM B-APT
. O

The O
PLATINUM B-APT

most O
frequently O

Microsoft B-IDTY
has O
designated O
Dipsind B-MAL
, O
although O
some O

The O
technique O
PLATINUM B-APT
uses O

not O
attempt O
to O
evade O
this O

such O
as O

Even O
if O

ultimately O
, O
SMEP O

it O
more O
difficult O
for O
PLATINUM B-APT

We O
confirmed O
that O
the O

did O
not O
expose O

, O
but O
rather O
misused O

In O
either O

One O
possibility O
is O
that O
PLATINUM B-APT
might O
have O
obtained O

Another O
possibility O
is O
that O

made O

the O

multiple O

that O

Later O
technical O

Unit B-SECTEAM

believes O
this O
group O
is O
previously O
unidentified O
and O
therefore O
have O
we O
have O
dubbed O
it O
" O
RANCOR B-APT
" O
. O

The O
Rancor B-APT
group I-APT
's O
attacks B-ACT
use O
two O
primary O
malware O
families O
which O
we O
describe O
in O
depth O
later O
in O
this O
blog O
and O
are O
naming O
DDKONG B-MAL
and O
PLAINTEE B-MAL
. O

We O
identified O
decoy B-FILE
files I-FILE
which O
indicate O
these O
attacks B-ACT
began O
with O
spear B-ACT
phishing I-ACT
messages I-ACT
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O
actual O
messages O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-APT
attackers O
were O
targeting O
political B-IDTY
entities I-IDTY
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy B-FILE
documents I-FILE
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O
government O
website O
belonging O
to O
the O
Cambodia B-IDTY
Government I-IDTY
and O
in O
at O
least O
once O
case O
, O
Facebook B-IDTY
. O

Our O
Investigation O
into O
both O
clusters O
further O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
both O
involved O
in O
attacks B-ACT
targeting O
organizations O
in O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia I-LOC
. O

We O
observed O
DDKONG B-MAL
in O
use O
between O
February B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
and O
the O
present O
, O
while O
PLAINTEE B-MAL
is O
a O
newer O
addition O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
sample O
being O
observed O
in O
October B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
. O

The O
RANCOR B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
represents O
a O
continued O
trend O
of O
targeted B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
against O
entities O
within O
the O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia I-LOC
region O
. O

They O
are O
interested O
in O
users O
of O
remote O
banking O
systems O
( O
RBS B-IDTY
) O
, O
mainly O
in O
Russia B-LOC
and O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

That O
this O
Rancor B-APT
is O
mostly O
targeting O
businesses B-IDTY
is O
apparent O
from O
the O
processes O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
on O
a O
compromised O
system O
. O

While O
both O
RTM B-TOOL
and O
Buhtrap B-MAL
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quite O
similar O
process O
list O
, O
the O
infection O
vectors O
are O
quite O
different O
. O

This O
Rancor B-APT
has O
used O
a O
large O
array O
of O
infection O
vectors O
, O
mostly O
revolving O
around O
drive-by B-ACT
downloads I-ACT
and O
spam B-ACT
. O

They O
are O
both O
targeting O
businesses B-IDTY
using O
accounting O
software O
, O
are O
fingerprinting O
systems O
of O
interest O
similarly O
, O
are O
looking O
for O
smart O
card O
readers O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
they O
deploy O
an O
array O
of O
malicious O
tools O
to O
spy O
on O
their O
victims O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
samples O
SHA-1 B-ENCR
AA0FA4584768CE9E16D67D8C529233E99FF1BBF0 B-SHA1
and O
48BC113EC8BA20B8B80CD5D4DA92051A19D1032B B-SHA1
. O

Despite O
its O
known O
weaknesses O
, O
the O
RC4 B-ENCR
algorithm O
is O
regularly O
used O
by O
malware O
authors O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
use O
of O
the O
relatively O
unique O

the O

each O
cluster O
, O
and O
the O
similar O

, O
we O
have O
grouped O
these O
attacks B-ACT
together O
under O
the O
RANCOR B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
moniker O
. O

Bdo O
is O
the O
Russian B-LOC
translation O
for O
RBS B-IDTY
( O
Remote B-IDTY
Banking I-IDTY
System I-IDTY
) O
so O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
RBS B-IDTY
is O
a O
target O
for O
this O
malware O
. O

Other O
groups O
, O
such O
as O
Buhtrap B-APT
, O
Corkow B-APT
and O
Carbanak B-APT
, O
were O
already O
known O
to O

and O
successfully O
steal B-ACT
money I-ACT
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions I-IDTY
and O
their O
customers B-IDTY
in O
Russia B-LOC
. O

Our O
research O
on O
the O
RTM B-MAL
malware I-MAL
shows O
that O
the O
Russian B-LOC
banking B-IDTY
system I-IDTY
is O
still O
a O

This O

is O
believed O
to O

In O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, O
BlackEnergy B-APT
caught O
our O
attention O
when O
we O
noticed O
that O

In O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, O
we O
noted O
that O
certain O
samples O
of O
BlackEnergy B-MAL
malware I-MAL
began O
targeting O
Ukranian B-LOC
government B-IDTY
organizations I-IDTY
for O

we O
have O
identified O
were O
conducted O
in O
2015 B-TIME

the O
Scarlet B-APT
has O
a O
significant O

though O
some O
evidence O
suggests O
even O
earlier O
activity B-ACT
by O
the O
SilverTerrier B-APT

SilverTerrier B-APT
actors I-APT
, O
especially O
those O
at O
the O

seeking O
opportunities O

elaborate O
, O
advanced O
operations O
to O
gain O
leverage O
, O
seize O
strategic O

The O
tools O
and O
techniques O
used O
throughout O
these O
attacks B-ACT

consistent O
with O
several O
Chinese B-LOC
actors I-APT
, O
such O
as O
APT10 B-APT

The O
APT10 B-APT
actor I-APT

to O
compromise B-ACT
critical I-ACT
assets I-ACT

such O
as O
database B-ACT
servers I-ACT
, O
billing B-ACT
servers I-ACT
, O
and O
the O
active B-ACT

The O
attack B-ACT
began O
with O
a O
web B-TOOL
shell I-TOOL
running O
on O
a O
vulnerable O
, O
publicly-facing O
server O
, O
from O
which O
the O
APT10 B-APT
gathered O
information O
about O
the O
network O
and O
propagated O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
initial O
indicator O
of O
the O
attack B-ACT
was O
a O
malicious O
web O
shell O
that O
was O
detected O
on O
an O
IIS B-TOOL
server O
, O
coming O
out O
of O

, O
uncovered O
several O
attack B-ACT
phases O

The O
APT10 B-APT
actor I-APT

able O
to O
leverage O
the O

run O
reconnaissance B-ACT
commands I-ACT
, O
steal B-ACT
credentials B-IDTY

and O
deploy B-ACT

has O
been O
used O
in O
many O
attacks B-ACT

such O
as O

The O
most O
common O
credential O

the O
China B-APT
actor I-APT
was O
a O
modified O
mimikatz B-TOOL

The O
China B-APT
actor I-APT
relied O
on O

PsExec B-TOOL
to O
move O
laterally O
and O
install O
their O

A O
second O
method O

by O
the O
Shadow B-APT

The O
malware B-MAL
appends O
encrypted O
data O
files O
with O
the O
.WCRY B-FILE
extension I-FILE
, O
drops O

executes O
a O

, O
and O
demands O
$300 O
or O
$600 O
USD O
(via O

to O
decrypt O
the O

. O

The O
malware B-MAL
then O
builds O
two O
DLLs B-FILE
in O
memory O
they O
are O
32 O
and O
64-bit O
DLLs O
that O
have O
identical O

The O
malware B-MAL
continues O
by O

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
Shadow B-APT
group I-APT
that O
specializes O
in O
payment B-ACT
card I-ACT
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
Shadow B-APT
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
Labs I-SECTEAM
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
credentials I-IDTY
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking B-ACT
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising B-ACT
payment B-IDTY
card I-IDTY
processing I-IDTY
devices I-IDTY
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
Shadow B-APT
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate B-ACT
further I-ACT
card I-ACT
information B-IDTY
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
Shadow B-APT
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-TOOL
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove B-ACT
any I-ACT
evidence I-ACT
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
Shadow B-APT
is O
changing B-ACT
their I-ACT
system's I-ACT
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
Shadow B-APT
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-TOOL
MAC I-TOOL
Address I-TOOL
Changer I-TOOL
. O

We O
have O
observed O
these O
Shadow B-APT
using O
Tor B-TOOL
or O
proxy-based B-TOOL
tools I-TOOL
similar O
to O
Tor B-TOOL
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them B-FILE
using O
virtual I-ACT
private I-ACT
network I-ACT
services I-ACT
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure B-ACT
anonymity I-ACT
and O
obfuscate B-ACT
criminal I-ACT
operations I-ACT
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
Shadow B-APT
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise B-ACT
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian B-LOC
threat O
Shadow B-APT
via O
social B-ACT
media I-IDTY
forums I-IDTY
such O
as O
Facebook O
, O
Skype O
, O
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp B-TOOL
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Shadow B-APT
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-TOOL
credentials I-TOOL
, O
personal B-TOOL
information I-TOOL
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O
forums O
for O
fraud B-ACT
purposes I-ACT
. O

These O
Shadow B-APT
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly B-ACT
access I-ACT
databases I-ACT
. O

Shadow B-APT
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian B-LOC
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil B-LOC
. O

The O
Shadow B-APT
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-TOOL
injection I-TOOL
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij O
Advanced O
SQL O
Injection O
Tool O
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O
4) O
to O
scan B-ACT
for I-ACT
and O
exploit B-ACT
vulnerabilities I-ACT
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers B-APT
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-TOOL
credentials I-TOOL
, O
these O
sellers B-APT
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate B-ACT
new I-ACT
card I-ACT
numbers I-ACT
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk B-TOOL
card-checking I-TOOL
tool O
this O
sellers B-APT
uses O
is O
Testador O
Amazon.com B-DOM

. O

Despite O
its O
name O
, O
this O

does O
not O
use O

but O
exploits O
an O
unauthenticated O

the B-LOC
U.S. I-LOC
(nearly O
half) O
, O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
and O
France B-LOC
. O

The O
sellers B-APT
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create B-ACT
cloned I-ACT
physical I-ACT
cards I-ACT
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw B-ACT
funds I-ACT
from O
ATMs B-TOOL
. O

The O
sellers B-APT
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-TOOL
606 I-TOOL
Software I-TOOL
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-TOOL
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create B-ACT
cloned I-ACT
cards I-ACT
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian B-LOC
sellers B-APT
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen B-ACT
cards I-ACT
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
bill's O
value O
and O
reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O
goods O
. O

Some O
sellers B-APT
tools O
were O
used O
to O
almost O
exclusively O
target O
organizations O
within O
APAC B-LOC
. O

In O
April B-TIME
2015 I-TIME
, O
we O
uncovered O
the O
malicious O

of O
APT30 B-APT
, O
a O
suspected O
China-based B-LOC

group O
that O
has O
exploited O
the O

, O
targeting O
highly O
sensitive B-IDTY
political I-IDTY

. O

The O
individuals B-APT
using O
Hancitor B-MAL
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor B-MAL
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal B-ACT
data I-IDTY
from O
their O
victims O
. O

We O
recently O
observed O
Hancitor B-APT
attacks O
against O
some O
of O
our O
FireEye B-SECTEAM

customers O
. O

The O
Hancitor B-APT
has O
performed O
these O
activities O
at O
multiple O
locations O
across O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
possibly O
using O
multiple O

. O

Once O
downloaded O
and O
executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O
intermediate O

that O
further O
downloads O
a O
Pony B-MAL

Vawtrak B-MAL
executable O
, O
which O
perform O

theft I-ACT
and O
connect B-ACT

Group-IB B-SECTEAM
specialists O
have O
established O
that O
the O

to O
deliver B-ACT

launch B-ACT
the O
second O

of O
Silences B-APT

APT10 B-APT
tends O
to O
employ B-ACT
a O

their O

that O

confuse B-ACT
the O

by O
posing O

a O
legitimate O

If O
the O
attack O
had O
succeeded O
, O
it O
would O
have O
given O
APT10 B-APT
control B-ACT
over I-ACT
the O

have O

the O
APT10 B-APT
actors I-APT
breach O
the O

to O
use O
as O
a O
beachhead O
, O
then O
attempt O
to O
move B-ACT

across O
the O

via O
stolen B-IDTY

exploiting B-ACT

The O

of O
them O
is O
the O
well-known O

which O
specializes O
in O

various B-IDTY

zero-day B-VULNAME
vulnerability I-VULNAME
in O
Java O
to O
deploy O
PIVY B-MAL
in O
2012 B-TIME
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
Carbanak B-MAL
campaign B-ACT
is O
a O
clear O
indicator O
of O
a O
new O
era O
in O
cybercrime O
in O
which O
criminals B-APT
use O
APT B-ACT
techniques I-ACT
directly O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
instead O
of O
through O
its O
customers O
. O

Carbanak B-MAL
has O
its O
origin O
in O
more O
common O
financial O
fraud O
including O
theft B-ACT
from O
consumer O
and O
corporate O
bank O
accounts O
in O
Europe B-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
, O
using O
standard O
banking O
malware O
, O
mainly O
Carberp B-MAL
. O

However O
, O
in O
September B-TIME
last O
year O
, O
our O
friends O
at O
CSIS B-SECTEAM
published O
a O
blog O
detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-MAL
variant O
affecting O
one O
of O
its O
customers O
. O

The O
malware B-MAL
was O
first O
seen O
packed O
with O
VMProtect; B-ACT
when O
unpacked O
the O
sample O
didnt O
show O
any O
similarities O
with O
previously O
known O
malware O
. O

The O
malware B-MAL
starts O
communicating B-ACT
with I-ACT
the I-ACT
C&C I-ACT
server O
by O
sending O
basic O
information O
about O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

The O
malware B-MAL
basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-TOOL
terminal O
for O
the O
criminals B-APT
, O
enabling O
them O
to O
execute B-ACT
scripts/commands I-ACT
and O
receive O
the O
results O
via O
HTTP B-PROT
requests O
. O

After O
app O
installation O
, O
whenever O
SWAnalytics B-MAL
senses O
victims O
opening O
up O
infected O
applications O
or O
rebooting O
their O
phones O
, O
it O
silently O
uploads B-ACT
their O
entire O
contacts O
list O
to O
Hangzhou O
Shun O
Wang O
Technologies O
controlled O
servers O
. O

This O
module B-FILE
monitors O
a O

installation I-ACT
/ O
remove B-ACT
/ O
update B-ACT
, O
phone B-IDTY
restart I-ACT
and O
battery B-ACT
charge I-ACT
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
contacts B-ACT
data I-IDTY
isnt O
the O
only O
unusual O
data O
SWAnalytics B-MAL
is O
interested O
in O
. O

With O
default O
settings O
, O
SWAnalytics B-MAL
will O
scan B-ACT
through O
an O
Android O

, O
looking O
for O

tencent/MobileQQ/WebViewCheck O
. O

By O
listing B-ACT
sub-folders I-ACT
, O
SWAnalytics B-MAL
is O
able O
to O
infer B-ACT
QQ I-ACT
accounts I-ACT
which O
have O
never O
been O
used O
on O
the O
device O
. O

To O
make O
this O
data O
harvesting O
operation O
flexible O
, O
SWAnalytics B-MAL
equips O
the O
ability O
to O
receive O
and O
process O
configuration B-FILE
files I-FILE
from O
a O
remote B-TOOL
Command-and-Control I-TOOL

Just O
to O
highlight O
its O
capabilities O
, O
TajMahal B-MAL
is O
able O
to O
steal B-ACT
data I-IDTY
from O
a O
CD O
burnt O
by O
a O
victim O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O
printer O
queue O
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MAL
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating B-ACT
files B-FILE
to O
the O
C&C B-TOOL
as O
well O
as O
downloading B-ACT
files B-FILE
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

The O
tool O
does O
all O
that O
a O
typical O
Trojan B-MAL
needs O
to O
accomplish: O
upload B-ACT
, O
download B-ACT
and O
execute B-ACT
files B-FILE
, O
fingerprint B-ACT
target B-IDTY
systems I-IDTY
. O

The O
PowerShell B-TOOL

The O
methods O
employed O
by O
Glimpse B-MAL
to O
perform O
DNS B-PROT
communications O
are O
determined O
by O
the O
mode O
in O
which O
it O
is O
operating O
(i.e., O

or O

) O
. O

The O
first O
DNS B-PROT
query O
by O
Glimpse B-MAL
requests O
the O

to O
be O
used O
in O
future O
communications O
with O
the O
controller O
(i.e., O

that O

not O
99.250.250.199 B-IP
, O
the O
malware O
will O
use O

. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
the O

was O
the O
reverse O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O

is O
that O

What O
makes O

special O
is O
that O
it O
was O
written O
in O
Python B-TOOL

designed O
to O
work O
on O
both O
Windows B-OS

; O
it O
is O
the O
first O

seen O
from O
the O

. O

One O
plausible O
reason O
for O
developing O
such O
a O
flexible O
malware O
might O
be O
that O
the O
group O
were O
increasingly O
encountering O

a O
Windows B-OS

( O
written O
in O

and O

in O
two O
